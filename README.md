# Hi, I'm LuckJMG 👋

> Because things should be Free, Simple and Private.

Computer Science student at the Federico Santa María University. I really like learning and coding all sort of things, from Science and Math to Literature and Art, and also sharing all the interesting things I learn (currently working on how to share them).

## I have learned some things...

**Languages:**
- **🐍 Python**, my first language!!!
- **💻 C++**, I had my fair amount of `core dumped`
- **🐹 Go**, `if (err != nil) { fmt.Println("I didn't expect this") }`
- **🐚 Shell**, Linux for programming >>>>
- **⚡ JavaScript**, I really hate JavaScript, but its the only way...
- **🌐 HTML5**, well I have made webpages
- **🎨 CSS3**, styling isn't my fortitude, but I defend myself
- **📝 Markdown**, I LOVE MARKDOWN

**Tools:**
- **🧩 Neovim**, my main editor 'cause I love customizing my tools
- **🌳 Git**, still struggle with merges
- **🐋 Docker**, don't like installing dependencies
